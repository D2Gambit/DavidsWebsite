# David's Website
This repo is a training exercise to teach David HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
We will document our learnings in this readme.

1. Basics of HTML (Heading 1 and Paragraph)
```dtd
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <body>
        <h1>David's Website</h1>
        <p>
            This is a paragraph on David's website. We are learning HTML together and we are going to build an awesome website!
            If you don't believe me, just watch and see! We're doing this because we're bored.
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
